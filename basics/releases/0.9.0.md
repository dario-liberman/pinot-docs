# 0.9.0

## Summary

This release introduces a new features: Segment Merge and Rollup to simplify users day to day operational work. A new metrics plugin is added to support dropwizard. As usual, new functionalities and many UI/ Performance improvements.

The release was cut from the following commit: [13c9ee9](https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/13c9ee9556498bb6dc4ab60734743edb8b89773c) and the following cherry-picks: [668b5e0](https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/668b5e01d7c263e3cdb3081e0a947a43e7d7f782), [ee887b9](https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/ee887b97e77ef7a132d3d6d60f83a800e52d4555)

### Support Segment Merge and Roll-up

LinkedIn operates a large multi-tenant cluster that serves a business metrics dashboard, and noticed that their tables consisted of millions of small segments. This was leading to slow operations in Helix/Zookeeper, long running queries due to having too many tasks to process, as well as using more space because of a lack of compression.

To solve this problem they added the Segment Merge task, which compresses segments based on timestamps and rolls up/aggregates older data. The task can be run on a schedule or triggered manually via the Pinot REST API.

At the moment this feature is only available for offline tables, but will be added for real-time tables in a future release.

Major Changes:

* Integrate enhanced SegmentProcessorFramework into MergeRollupTaskExecutor ([#7180](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7180))
