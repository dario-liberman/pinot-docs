# 0.8.0

## Summary

This release introduced several awesome new features, including compatibility tests, enhanced complex type and Json support, partial upsert support, and new stream ingestion plugins (AWS Kinesis, Apache Pulsar). It contains a lot of query enhancements such as new `timestamp` and `boolean` type support and flexible numerical column comparison. It also includes many key bug fixes. See details below.

The release was cut from the following commit: fe83e95aa9124ee59787c580846793ff7456eaa5

## Special notes

* After the 0.8.0 release, we will officially support jdk 11, and can now safely start to use jdk 11 features. Code is still compilable with jdk 8 ([#6424](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6424))
*   RealtimeToOfflineSegmentsTask config has some backward incompatible changes ([#7158](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7158))

    â€” `timeColumnTransformFunction` is removed (backward-incompatible, but rollup is not supported anyway)

    â€” Deprecate `collectorType` and replace it with `mergeType`

    â€” Add `roundBucketTimePeriod` and `partitionBucketTimePeriod` to config the time bucket for round and partition
* Regex path for pluggable `MinionEventObserverFactory` is changed from `org.apache.pinot.*.event.*` to `org.apache.pinot.*.plugin.minion.tasks.*` ([#6980](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6980))
* Moved all pinot built-in minion tasks to the `pinot-minion-builtin-tasks` module and package them into a shaded jar ([#6618](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6618))
* Reloading consuming segment flag `pinot.server.instance.reload.consumingSegment` will be true by default ([#7078](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7078))
* Move JSON decoder from `pinot-kafka` to `pinot-json` package. ([#7021](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7021))
* Backward incompatible schema change through controller rest API `PUT /schemas/{schemaName}` will be blocked. ([#6737](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6737))
* Deprecated `/tables/validateTableAndSchema` in favor of the new configs/validate API and introduced new APIs for `/tableConfigs` to operate on the real-time table config, offline table config and schema in one shot. ([#6840](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6840))
