# 0.6.0

## Summary

This release introduced some excellent new features, including upsert, tiered storage, pinot-spark-connector, support of having clause, more validations on table config and schema, support of ordinals in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clause, array transform functions, adding push job type of segment metadata only mode, and some new APIs like updating instance tags, new health check endpoint. It also contains many key bug fixes. See details below.

The release was cut from the following commit:\
[e5c9bec](https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/e5c9bec4d970005850da548a42a4fb6ba79a620e) and the following cherry-picks:

## Special notes

* Brokers should be upgraded before servers in order to keep backward-compatible:
  * Change group key delimiter from '\t' to '\0' ([#5858](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5858))
  * Support for exact distinct count for non int data types ([#5872](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5872))
*   Pinot Components have to be deployed in the following order:

    (PinotServiceManager -> Bootstrap services in role ServiceRole.CONTROLLER -> All remaining bootstrap services in parallel)

    * Starts Broker and Server in parallel when using ServiceManager ([#5917](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5917))
    * New settings introduced and old ones deprecated:
    * Make real-time threshold property names less ambiguous ([#5953](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5953))
    * Change Signature of Broker API in Controller ([#6119](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6119))
* This aggregation function is still in beta version. This PR involves change on the format of data sent from server to broker, so it works only when both broker and server are upgraded to the new version:
  * Enhance DistinctCountThetaSketchAggregationFunction ([#6004](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6004))

* Fix built-in virtual columns for immutable segment ([#6042](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6042))
* Refresh the routing when real-time segment is committed ([#6078](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6078))
* Add support for Decimal with Precision Sum aggregation ([#6053](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6053))
